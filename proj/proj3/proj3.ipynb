    "In this project, we'll be working with one month of data from sensors in buildings at UC Berkeley. This is a very typical real-world dataset—i.e. it's kind of a mess. The full dataset contains a giant `data` table of many billions of sensor readings over the course of a decade; we will look at a single month of that data. It also contains a variety of other tables that contextualize the readings.\n",

    "Now that we understand the graph properties of the ontology, let's use the ontology to do a roll-up as intended. Remember from [lecture 13](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19Nsksm89k8NBap9rwINJJFJeZCDSmF-feM6o0mz868c/edit?usp=sharing) that a roll-up is transforming to coarser grain (e.g., go up in a hierarchy). We're interested in the number of unique sensor `id`s from `metadata` that are transitively in subclasses of each \"Sensor child\" class. To compute this, you will have to associate each `metadata.id` with a matching `brickclass` *(if there is one!)*, and use the `transitive_subClassOf` view to identify all \"Sensor children\" for which the matching `brickclass` is transitively in a `subClass`. (If the `subClass` predicate is a DAG, then each `id` should be counted for *all* the direct subclasses of `Sensor` that it's transitively underneath.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a query that returns tuples of the form `(sensor_child, count)` that returns for each \"Sensor child\" the count of **distinct** `metadata.id` entries that are subclasses of that \"Sensor child\" class. Only output tuples that have a matching `brickclass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- It may be helpful to first create a CTE where you identify the unique sensor children\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to `data/schema.png` for a refresher on the schema. This will be helpful to identify:\n",
    "- how you can associate sensors in `metadata` with a matching `brickclass` via `mapping`\n",
    "- how you can use the `transitive_subClassOf` view which has attributes `object` and `subject` just like `ontology` to match \"Sensor children\" with `brickclass`\n"
